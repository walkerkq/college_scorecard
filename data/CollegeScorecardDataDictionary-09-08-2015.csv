For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution for the length of the full program (see LProgram), regardless of program length, and it includes undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year."378,,Average cost of attendance (program-year institutions),cost,attendance.program_year,integer,COSTT4_P,,,IPEDS,379,,In-state tuition and fees,cost,tuition.in_state,integer,TUITIONFEE_IN,,,IPEDS,380,,Out-of-state tuition and fees,cost,tuition.out_of_state,integer,TUITIONFEE_OUT,,,IPEDS,381,,Tuition and fees for program-year institutions,cost,tuition.program_year,integer,TUITIONFEE_PROG,,,IPEDS,382,TRUE,Net tuition revenue per full-time equivalent student,school,tuition_revenue_per_fte,integer,TUITFTE, ,,IPEDS,"Net tuition revenue (tuition revenue minus discounts and allowances) divided by the number of FTE students (undergraduates and graduate students) (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/glossary/index.asp?id=854).
